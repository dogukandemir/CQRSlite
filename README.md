A lightweight CQRS and Event Sourcing framework for .NET

## Overview

CQRSlite is a small, focused CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing framework for .NET. It provides the essential building blocks for implementing CQRS/ES patterns while maintaining flexibility and pluggability.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Minimal dependencies (only Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory)
- Targets netstandard2.0 and net9.0
- Convention-based event application with performance optimization
- Pluggable architecture - replace any component with custom implementations
- Thread-safe caching and repository decorators

CQRSlite originated as a CQRS sample project by Greg Young and Gaute Magnussen in 2010. Original code: http://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r

## Features

- **Command Sending** - Dispatch commands to handlers with 1:1 routing
- **Event Publishing** - Publish events to multiple handlers (1:N routing)
- **Query Processing** - Process queries with typed results
- **Unit of Work** - Session-based aggregate tracking for consistency
- **Repository Pattern** - Get and save aggregates with event sourcing
- **Optimistic Concurrency** - Built-in concurrency checking and conflict detection
- **Message Router** - Automatic handler registration via reflection
- **Snapshotting** - Performance optimization for aggregates with many events
- **Caching** - Thread-safe caching layer with automatic invalidation

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
dotnet add package CQRSlite
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Define your messages:**

```csharp
// Command
public class CreateProduct : ICommand
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

// Event
public class ProductCreated : IEvent
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public int Version { get; set; }
    public DateTimeOffset TimeStamp { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

2. **Create your aggregate:**

```csharp
public class Product : AggregateRoot
{
    private string _name;
    private decimal _price;

    public Product(Guid id, string name, decimal price)
    {
        Id = id;
        ApplyChange(new ProductCreated(id, name, price));
    }

    private Product() { } // Required for rehydration

    private void Apply(ProductCreated e)
    {
        _name = e.Name;
        _price = e.Price;
    }
}
```

3. **Implement handlers:**

```csharp
public class ProductCommandHandler : ICommandHandler<CreateProduct>
{
    private readonly ISession _session;

    public async Task Handle(CreateProduct message)
    {
        var product = new Product(message.Id, message.Name, message.Price);
        await _session.Add(product);
        await _session.Commit();
    }
}
```

4. **Configure services:**

```csharp
// Register Router
var router = new Router();
services.AddSingleton(router);
services.AddSingleton<ICommandSender>(router);
services.AddSingleton<IEventPublisher>(router);
services.AddSingleton<IHandlerRegistrar>(router);

// Register core services
services.AddSingleton<IEventStore, YourEventStore>(); // You must implement this
services.AddScoped<IRepository>(sp => new Repository(sp.GetService<IEventStore>()));
services.AddScoped<ISession, Session>();

// Auto-register handlers
var registrar = new RouteRegistrar(serviceProvider);
registrar.Register(typeof(ProductCommandHandler).Assembly);
```

## External Resources

Great introductions to CQRS and CQRSlite:
- [CQRS: A Cross-Examination of How It Works](https://www.codeproject.com/articles/991648/cqrs-a-cross-examination-of-how-it-works)
- [Real-World CQRS ES with ASP.NET and Redis](https://exceptionnotfound.net/real-world-cqrs-es-with-asp-net-and-redis-part-1-overview/)

## Requirements

You **must** implement your own `IEventStore` for persistence. CQRSlite provides the framework but intentionally does not include a default event store implementation, as storage requirements vary greatly between applications.

Example event stores:
- SQL Server / PostgreSQL / MySQL
- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, CosmosDB)
- Event Store DB
- Azure Table Storage
- In-memory (for testing, included in sample)

See [DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md#implementing-event-store) for implementation guidance.

## Architecture

CQRSlite follows clean CQRS/ES principles:

```
Application Layer
    ↓
Commands → CommandHandlers → Aggregates → Events → EventStore
    ↓                                          ↓
Queries → QueryHandlers → ReadModels ← EventHandlers
```

**Write Side (Commands):**
- Commands express intent to change state
- Aggregates enforce business rules
- Events record what happened
- Event store persists events

**Read Side (Queries):**
- Events update denormalized read models
- Queries read from optimized projections
- Eventually consistent with write side
